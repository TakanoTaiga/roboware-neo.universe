# foxglove_msgs/msg/TrianglesMarker
# A marker representing a set of triangles or a surface tiled by triangles

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/schemas

# Timestamp of the marker
builtin_interfaces/Time timestamp

# Frame of reference
string frame_id

# Identifier for the marker. A marker will replace any prior marker on the same topic with the same `id`.
string id

# Length of time (relative to `timestamp`) after which the marker should be automatically removed. Zero value indicates the marker should remain visible until it is replaced or deleted.
builtin_interfaces/Duration lifetime

# Whether the marker should keep its location in the fixed frame (false) or follow the frame specified in `frame_id` as it moves relative to the fixed frame (true)
bool frame_locked

# Additional user-provided metadata associated with the marker. Keys must be unique.
foxglove_msgs/KeyValuePair[] metadata

# Origin of triangles relative to reference frame
geometry_msgs/Pose pose

# Vertices to use for triangles, interpreted as a list of triples (0-1-2, 3-4-5, ...)
geometry_msgs/Point[] points

# Solid color to use for the whole shape. One of `color` or `colors` must be provided.
foxglove_msgs/Color color

# Per-vertex colors (if specified, must have the same length as `points`). One of `color` or `colors` should be provided.
foxglove_msgs/Color[] colors

# Indices into the `points` and `colors` attribute arrays, which can be used to avoid duplicating attribute data.
# 
# If omitted or empty, indexing will not be used. This default behavior is equivalent to specifying [0, 1, ..., N-1] for the indices (where N is the number of `points` provided).
